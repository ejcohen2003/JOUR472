# Data cleaning and first analysis

The dataset is pulled from BoardGameGeek, a user-submitted website for game ratings. The data was pulled about three years ago. There 20,343 rows and 14 columns. An initial analysis of shows about 19,900 games in the dataset. There are some columns with some missing data, such as year published.

```{r}
#Dataset was cleaned in OpenRefine to replace semicolon-separated values with comma-separated values, and to convert rating values with commas to values with decimals. It was also clustered to clean about 75 games that had similar name variants.
